                This is a language-guessing game, and you might have played some before.
                Here, however, things are different. All you have is pages of glyphs,
                numbers and pictures. There is almost no text in the gameplay. Moreover,
                you don't know what's right and what's wrong. The game does not provide
                answers.
            </p>

                I have had the idea(and built the language) long ago, but never
                actually had the determination to make it until I played Chants of
                Sennar.
            </p>

                I hope you enjoy it.
